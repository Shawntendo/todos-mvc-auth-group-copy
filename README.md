- Edit History :
- 9-1-2022
  - added color property to user model in models/user.js
  - modified statement in controllers/todos.js that passed color property to todos.ejs along with the retrieved todos list
  - tried to add switch statement to select css files with dark mode options (the switch statement is incomplete and currently breaks the page)
  - Updated switch statement in .ejs so it works when the user logs in and the correct css will be loaded base on color property

- 9-2-2022
  - further changes to views/todos.ejs for switch case
  - added more color options (I've got no attachment to the color selection, please change them if you'd like)
